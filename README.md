# Run Lenth Encoding
An implementation of Run Length Encoding algorithm in C++

This basic function of this project is to Compression Ratio by analyzing randomness of any number set.

You can use any C++ compiler of your choice.

When you run this code it will:

    i. Create a text file "numbers.txt" with 1000 random numbers.
    ii. Read those random numbers from the text file and put them in a array.
    iii. Calculate Remainder (%) as divided by 5, 6 and 7 and store the results in separate arrays.
    iv. Create a 3*1000 matrix including the remainders.
    v. Implement ROW by ROW RLE.
    vi. Implement Column by Column RLE.
    vii. Calculate ROW by ROW and Column by Column compression ratio.
    viii. Display the result showing first 10 values and overall compression ratio.


Thank you for using my code.
